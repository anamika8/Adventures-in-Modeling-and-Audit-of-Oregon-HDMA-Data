# Background

The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) requires many financial institutions to maintain, report, and publicly disclose loan-level information about mortgages. These data help show whether lenders are serving the housing needs of their communities; they give public officials information that helps them make decisions and policies; and they shed light on lending patterns that could be discriminatory. The public data are modified to protect applicant and borrower privacy.

HMDA was originally enacted by Congress in 1975 and is implemented by Regulation C." - source - https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/hmda/
